# How to build GuessingGame?

It's very very easy... you must have downloaded a GCC GNU compiler
then if you have installed it you need to git clone guessing game repo

```
git clone https://github.com/SolindekDev/guessing-game
```

then write into the console

```
cd guessing-game
```

and

```
make
```

if you do not have installed make file just write into the console

```
gcc src/main.c
```

should create a a.exe or a.out file then just open it with console or if you on windows just open it
